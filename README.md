# FPGA Snake Videogame
## Description
In this project, the snake video game adapted to a multiplayer mode is developed, showing two snakes controlled by two players where the speed of movement increases as time passes and the objective is not to collide with the limits or with the enemy snake. The movement of the snakes is done based on the selection of four buttons that represent the directions up, down, left and right. While the control algorithm is found in an ALTERA CYCLON IV FPGA, which projects the video game on a monitor through a VGA cable.
